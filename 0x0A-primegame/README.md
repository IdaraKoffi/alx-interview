# 0x0A. Prime Game

## Description
This project is about determining the winner of a game involving prime numbers. Two players, Maria and Ben, take turns choosing a prime number from a set of consecutive integers starting from 1. Once a prime number is chosen, it and all its multiples are removed from the set. The player unable to make a move loses the round.

The game is played over multiple rounds, and the goal is to determine which player wins the most rounds, assuming both play optimally.

- Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes for efficient computation of prime numbers.
- Apply basic game theory concepts to solve competitive game scenarios.
- Optimize algorithms using precomputation and efficient iteration.
- Improve Python programming skills, particularly in loops, conditional statements, and list manipulation.
