Minimum Operations Project
Project Overview
This project involves writing a Python function that calculates the minimum number of operations needed to produce exactly n characters "H" starting from a single "H". You are only allowed two operations:

Copy All: Copies all characters in the current text.
Paste: Pastes the last copied characters.
The challenge is to find the most efficient way to reach n characters.

Requirements
You are required to create a Python file named 0-minoperations.py that contains a single function minOperations(n).
The solution should adhere to Pythonâ€™s PEP 8 style guide.
All files should be executable and include the shebang line #!/usr/bin/python3.
Function Prototype
python
Copy code
def minOperations(n):
Parameters
n (integer): The target number of characters.
Return Value
Returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to achieve exactly n characters. If it is impossible to reach n, return 0.
Approach
The solution is based on factorizing n into its prime factors. Each factor represents a sequence of Copy All and Paste operations that are required to reach that number of characters in the minimum possible steps.

Example
For n = 9, the minimum sequence is:

Copy All
Paste (2 characters)
Paste (3 characters)
Copy All
Paste (6 characters)
Paste (9 characters)
Total operations = 6.

File Structure
This repository contains the following files:

0-minoperations.py: Contains the minOperations function.
0-main.py: Test file to verify the functionality of the minOperations function.
README.md: Project documentation.
Usage
Clone this repository.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-interview.git
cd alx-interview/0x02-minimum_operations
Run the main file to test the function:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x 0-main.py
./0-main.py
Sample Output
plaintext
Copy code
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
Example Usage of minOperations
You can import and call the minOperations function in other Python scripts:

python
Copy code
from 0-minoperations import minOperations

n = 15
print("Min number of operations to reach {} characters: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
Requirements for Submission
Ensure the following:

All code follows PEP 8 style.
Each file ends with a new line.
Files are executable.
The minOperations function is documented with comments explaining the code logic.
